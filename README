This is a real simple module that let's you make special variables that 
contain both a numeric and text part. (Like $!.)

Usage:

	use SetDualVar;

	SetDualVar $x, "hello", 4.12;

	print $x+1,"\n",$x.'|',"\n";
	
	
You may do whatever you like with this code. I, the author, Kenneth
Albanowski, hereby release all of the files included in this module
to the public domain.
